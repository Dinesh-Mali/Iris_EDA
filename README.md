# Iris_EDA
In this assignment I have performed simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Iris data set.
Exploratory data analysis is very important step to understand your data. It tells us about the statistics about the data and that help us to draw important inferences from our dataset. So it is recommended to analyse the data before applying machine learning models.

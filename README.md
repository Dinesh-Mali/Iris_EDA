# Iris_EDA
In this assignment I have performed simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Iris data set.
Exploratory data analysis is very important step to understand your data. It tells us about the statistics about the data and helps to draw important inferences from it. So it is recommended to analyse the data before heading directly towards applying machine learning models.
